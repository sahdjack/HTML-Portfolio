<h1>The Best Movies According to Jack</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Snatch</h3>
<p>This is my all time favorite movie.  The acting is amazing and the story is masterfully written.  
There are multiple stories happening at the same time in different places that come together and intersect at the end.</p>

<h3>Avengers</h3>
<p>This is the greatest superhero movie ever made.  Marvel took all the superheroes I grew up loving and did an amazing job bringing them all to life.</p>

<h3>Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of The Ring</h3>
<p>Peter Jackson did a masterful job bringing J.R.R. Tolkien's epic tales of Middle Earth to life.  It's hard to choose just one movie from this epic trilogy,
so I give it to The Fellowship of The Ring for kicking off the trilogy and setting the tone for the other movies to follow.</p>
