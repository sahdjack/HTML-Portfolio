<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello!  My name is Jack.  I'm a full-time stay at home dad turned Web Developer!  I still do the dad thing, but now I do the web thing too!  
I love to learn and I'm excited to<br/> grow my skills as a web developer.  My goal is to transition from stay at home dad to a full-time web developer.
</p>

<p>On the personal side, I call the Pacific Northwest home and I enjoy hiking and being outside every chance I get.  I also enjoy indoor activities like<br/> video games and sleeping.
Although I don't do it much as I'd like to, I enjoy traveling and seeing new places. </p>
